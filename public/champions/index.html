<p><strong>Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice.</strong></p>

<p><center><img src="/img/horst_openscapes_desert_roadrunner.png" width="100px"></center></p>

<h2 id="purpose">PURPOSE</h2>

<p>This mentorship program is for early career environmental researchers in leadership roles – faculty, lecturers, program managers, and others who want to establish open data science practices in their labs and on their campuses. It helps fill a gap left by graduate education, which often lacks formal computing and data training.</p>

<p>Openscapes empowers scientists by:</p>

<ul>
<li>mentoring them to become champions for open practices</li>
<li>supporting them to improve open practices within their labs and campuses</li>
<li>amplifying their stories and successes online</li>
</ul>

<!---Through mentorship meetings with Champions and members of their labs, Openscapes provides these emerging scientific leaders to have the opportunity to engage with existing open practices and guide their labs take the next steps appropriate for them.

**Openscapes helps scientists become visible champions for open data science practices and promote them through their labs, teaching, and departments.**

Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program for early career researchers in leadership roles (e.g. faculty, lecturers, program managers) that helps them become visible Champions for open practices. It is designed with the vision that although scientific leaders were not formally trained in open data science practices, they can value and enable these practices through their labs, teaching, and departments.

--->

<!---

This is creating more scientists who promote something they value, not creating champions in the sports context.

<p><center><img src="/img/horst_openscapes_desert_agave.png" width="100px"></center></p>

<h2 id="outcomes">OUTCOMES</h2>

<p>Openscapes Champions work towards building an efficient, open culture within their labs, and modeling that behavior to the broader campus community.</p>

<p>Openscapes Champions will be better equipped to:</p>

<ul>
<li>promote open data science practices in their labs and departments</li>
<li>enable an open culture in their lab, such as having

<ul>
<li>dedicated “data workflow” lab meetings</li>
<li>stated code of conduct or lab philosophy</li>
<li>beginnings of a lab roadmap of shared practices for data workflows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cultivate a local community of practice through study groups on campus (example: <a href="http://eco-data-science.github.io/">Eco-Data-Science</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><center><img src="/img/horst_openscapes_desert_tortoise.png" width="100px"></center></p>

<h2 id="process">PROCESS</h2>

<p>The Openscapes Champions program meets scientists where they are to help identify incremental steps that will make their data workflows and lab culture more efficient and open. It is a five-month program that is led remotely, with lessons designed for active participation by Champions and their lab members.</p>

<p>Each month, Champions will:</p>

<ul>
<li>strategize through one-on-one mentorship calls</li>
<li>learn about existing tools &amp; practices through two group calls that also include lab members</li>
<li>set, review, and meet goals while building relationships and staying accountable</li>
</ul>

<p>The program is modeled after <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/">Mozilla Open Leaders</a>, which provides training, mentorship, and best practices for working and leading in an open way.</p>

<!---
You don’t have to be a mentee to get involved in the culture shift. We welcome members of the broader scientific and open community to join us

<p>The Champions Program officially started in January 2019 with our inaugural cohort of seven Champions!</p>

<!---springing from informal conversations over several years. Future cohorts will involve a more formal nomination and selection process. --->

An ecologist studying the impacts of climate change on ocean life.
  
A marine aquaculture & fisheries scientist studying global systems. 

We physiological and biochemical traits underlying organismal adaptation to their habitat and how these traits are altered in response to changes in physical and chemical environmental factors

The unifying thread linking my work is the recovery and resilience of ocean ecosystems. I am motivated by a desire to deepen our basic understanding of how ecosystems are assembled and an urgent need to develop sustainable management strategies for coastal marine ecosystems.
