      <description>Introducing the Champions program By engaging, empowering, and amplifying scientists with cross-cutting open data science approaches, Openscapes aims to create a more efficient and collaborative open culture in environmental science, to enable better science in less time. Openscapes centers around the Champions program, which is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice.
There are many things to say about the Champions program, much more for a single post, and there will be more posts to come.</description>

      <title>Personifying code</title>

      <description>Personifying code Anything and everything we do to increase visibility of open practices and data science within environmental science communities is important. When we see things, it is easier to value them.
Openscapes Champion Allison Horst is doing this in part through her personifyr art series. She uses her art in the classroom at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where she is a lecturer of data science and statistics in an environmentally-focused graduate program, the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp;amp; Management.</description>

      <title>So you want to learn R</title>

      <description>So you want to learn R So you want to learn R, where do you start? There are a lot of written and video tutorials and books and blogs online, but how do you navigate them? Our Ocean Health Index team put together a list of the resources we used to learn R that helped our team&amp;rsquo;s path to better science in less time. But this might still not be helpful for where you should actually start.</description>

      <description>Introducing Openscapes This article was originally published on medium.com
I wrote this blog in preparation for MozFest — Mozilla’s annual festival for the open internet — October 2018, in London. I am a Mozilla Fellow, and I presented the idea of Openscapes, which will help increase the value of open practices within environmental science by engaging, empowering, and amplifying individuals.


As you know, we are currently facing some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time.</description>

      <description>How to start a coding club Summary: start small, be hands-on, use existing tutorials, have fun.
Here is my advice for starting a coding club.
An example is Eco-Data-Science at UCSB. We are currently a community of &amp;gt;100 people; we meet 2x/month at the UCSB Library&amp;rsquo;s Collaboratory and skill share peer-to-peer, with all resources organized and archived on the website. But we started off small, with co-founder Jamie giving tutorials to friends one-on-one.</description>

      <description>Build communities Openscapes is built with the idea that we can model the open culture we want in science. It starts with making open data science more visible and valued in our communities. So what can you do? All of the following involve seeking out opportunities to engage and learn, including others, and amplifying your efforts.
 read publications about open data science in academia in journal clubs. Examples:  Lowndes et al.</description>

      <description>Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp;amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Lowndes.

OUR STORY The Openscapes story starts with file names like &amp;ldquo;data_analysis_final_v2b.xls&amp;rdquo; — you know the ones.
In 2013, when a team of scientists at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) was leading the second annual Ocean Health Index assessment, they found themselves struggling with unruly documentation buried in forwarded emails and knew they needed to find a better way to analyze data in a collaborative way.</description>

      <description>Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice.

PURPOSE This mentorship program is for early career environmental researchers in leadership roles – faculty, lecturers, program managers, and others who want to establish open data science practices in their labs and on their campuses. It helps fill a gap left by graduate education, which often lacks formal computing and data training.</description>

      <description>This curated list of resources is meant to welcome environmental scientists who are curious about engaging in open data science. This R-focused list is not meant to be comprehensive of all the incredible resources available; it represents a selection of material immediately useful to scientists we have worked with. This page is under development and currently leverages previous work.

WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, &amp;amp; EFFICIENTLY Thinking deliberately about data and embracing existing open tools and workflows for science increases efficiency, broadens the scientific questions that can be asked, introduces a network of online allies outside scientific domains, and makes it easier to ask for help.</description>
