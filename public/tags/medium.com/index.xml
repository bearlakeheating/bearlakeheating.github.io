      <description>Introducing Openscapes This article was originally published on medium.com
I wrote this blog in preparation for MozFest — Mozilla’s annual festival for the open internet — October 2018, in London. I am a Mozilla Fellow, and I presented the idea of Openscapes, which will help increase the value of open practices within environmental science by engaging, empowering, and amplifying individuals.


As you know, we are currently facing some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time.</description>
