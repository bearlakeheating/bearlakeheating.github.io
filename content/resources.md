**This curated list of resources is meant to welcome environmental scientists who are curious about engaging in open data science.** This R-focused list is not meant to be comprehensive of all the incredible resources available; it represents a selection of material immediately useful to scientists we have worked with. *This page is under development and currently leverages previous work*.

## WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, & EFFICIENTLY

Thinking deliberately about data and embracing existing open tools and workflows for science increases efficiency, broadens the scientific questions that can be asked, introduces a network of online allies outside scientific domains, and makes it easier to ask for help.

For example, the Ocean Health Index describes how open software and borrowing practices from software engineers was game-changing for collaborative coding and communication.

<!---
Embrace existing open tools and workflows for science. There's not a single tool for all jobs, but can leverage existing workflows and streamline the amount of software (and user accounts) you need.

What unites us not what makes us different

The scope of environmental research spans vastly different ecosystems, scales, and organisms. But we are united by data: No matter what our questions are or how we gather information, we will need to analyze our data, and do so in a way that is efficient for ourselves and can be communicated to others.

## JOINING & BUILDING LEARNING COMMUNITIES

Learning to code should be fun since you are learning powerful and empowering tools that will be game-changing for your science. So learn with friends, and grow your community.

## R WITH RSTUDIO & GITHUB

We recommend using R with RStudio, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with RStudio's tidyverse & friends and with RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.
